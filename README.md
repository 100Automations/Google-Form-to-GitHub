# Title
Google Form to GitHub Issue Automation 

## Overview
Non-techies find it hard to work with issues on Github, and having to onboard them makes it more increases friction. A great way to solve this would be a ready made automation that turns Google forms into github issues, with enough configurations for you to select which project the issue goes to, tags, etc. based on the form.

### Problem Being Solved
It automates turning a Google Form into GitHub issues.

### Value Created from Solution
It saves time and it reduces friction. It's easier to report bugs, or to send new improvement proposals.

### Solution (simplified explanation)
It turns Google Forms submissions into GitHub issues.

### Stakeholders
Impact - who benefits and how?
- People who uses Github: Engineers, Devolepers from a Project.
- People who would like to report bugs on an Website, or an App but are not familiar to Github or wouldn't like to go through the hassle of creating an user acccount on Github to send their comments or suggestions.

## Technical Details
### Installation
TBD

### Current State
"As-is" most likely something manual but could be partially automated
This is still under the ideation process. We still need to figure out how to build it.

### Future Development
The “To-be” state
- Do research on what's the best solution to connect Google to Github.
- Use Google's codebase to connect to Github API.

### Anticipated technical outcomes

### Resources/Instructions
TBD: How to run the automation and any packages or dependencies 

### Language
- JavaScript

### Platform
Where is it deployed (e.g. GitHub, Linux Command Line, Windows Command Line etc)
- GitHub
- Google Form

### Automation triggers
- Any time a user sends a GoogleForm submission from the Website or App. 

### Input required
How much manual or custom input is required?
- The user should write the information on a Google Form.

### Output
What's the expected result? 
After the user submits the Google Form, a new issue is created on Github.

## API
TBD

### Versions/Updates
### Configuration
### Usage
